We're hiring a backend engineer with 2+ years of experience in Python, REST APIs, and database design. 
Experience with cloud platforms like AWS is a plus.

Example:

Match Score: 85

Explanation:
The candidate has strong experience with software engineering fundamentals, Node.js, and databases, which aligns well with the job description. However, there is no mention of Python or REST APIs, which are required, so the score is not higher.

You are a highly skilled AI candidate-matching agent.

Your job is to analyze how well a candidate's resume matches a given job description.

Return your response in the following format:
